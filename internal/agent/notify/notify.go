// message ID so non-interactive clients can reconcile stdout even if
// SSE events arrive out of order or are dropped by the broker. Error
// is non-empty when the run terminated with an error; Cancelled is
// true when the run terminated due to context cancellation. The two
// are mutually exclusive in the success case but may overlap when a
// cancel triggers a downstream error.
//
// RunID identifies the specific request that produced this event.
// It is the value the caller set on `proto.AgentMessage.RunID` (or
// equivalently propagated via agent.WithRunID on the context that
// reaches the coordinator); empty when no caller set one. Filtering
// by RunID lets a client correlate a SendMessage call with its
// terminal event even when the session is busy and other turns are
// finishing on the same session.
